This project is the code posted by ScottOrange on the MSDN. 
He developed a small program to allow use of the Kinect Camera as a webcam. 
Originally made for the Beta, he updated the code to the version 1.0 microsoft SDK.

@wildbillcat is no longer maintaining the project, as I no longer have access to the hardware since I've changed jobs.
